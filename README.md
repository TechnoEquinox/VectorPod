# vectormyboi
A companion Python application for the Anki Vector.

This is just currently a backup of all the work done so far. It's not pretty but I needed to update wirepod at some point and this needed to be backed up. 

robot_config.json and custom_page.html go under wire-pod/chipper/webroot/ to work properly
